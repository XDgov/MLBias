Build versus buy decisions
-------------

Once an oragnization has determined using an AI/Ml solution makes sense, the next step is often to weigh the option of buying a solution versus building and implementing a solution internally.  "Buying" a solution can include paying for access to an API, paying an external organization to build a custom solution, or acquiring an off-the-shelf solution. 

Note: Many powerful and standard AI/ML resources are freely availble, and others still are tied to computing platforms used across Census and the rest of the government, including Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and others. Free resources include feature stores, libraries for privacy-preserving machine learning, depp learning frameworks -- e.g., PyTorch and TensorFlow -- and widely-used libraries like spaCy are freely avaialble on Github and elsewhere, and a standard part of many AI/ML workflows in the private and public sector.   See, for example, [this Github repository](https://github.com/EthicalML/awesome-production-machine-learning) for a long list of open source (and commercial) tools.

There are several considerations for buying an ML solution versus building one in-house (potentially with the aid of open source solutions referenced above). Some of these considerations are agency- and group-specific, and out of scope for a general discussion like the one contained in this repository. Among the many considerations are: 

* The cost of one approach versus another
* One's ability to understand or "explain" the output from proprietary models not built in-house

### Technical

- [10718, 94889](https://github.com/dssg/mlforpublicpolicylab) **Data Analysis / Machine Learning for Public Policy Lab** *Carnegie Mellon University*, 2020 edition
	- This course, which assumes prior exposure to machine learning and proficiency with Python, is rich with material for those trying to get started building end-to-end machine learning pipelines for government applications, and who would like formal technical exposure to data analysis and machine learning work with ethical considerations. The course features a template for field projects suitable for training programs mini-courses. Lessons of interest to those interested in AI/ML ethics in civic tech/policy settings are the modules on Bias and Fairness, Model Explainability/Interpretability, and Field Validation.

- [RES.EC-001](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-ec-001-exploring-fairness-in-machine-learning-for-international-development-spring-2020/index.htm#) **Exploring Fairness in Machine Learning for International Developments** *MIT*, Spring 2020 
	- Lightly technical short course offered in full through MIT's free Open Courseware resource, geared toward those interested in implementable applied methods for AI/ML ethics. Notable resources are a series of video lectures, and full case studies featuring data and technical approaches, including: Mitigating Gender Bias on the UCI Adult Database, a case study on Pulmonary Health, and a case study on Identifying and Mitigating Unintended Demographic Bias in Machine Learning for NLP.


### Less Technical Courses

- [Data c104 / History c184d](https://data.berkeley.edu/data-c104-fall-2020-syllabus) **Human Contexts and Ethics of Data** *UC Berkeley* Fall 2020 

   - An interesting course jointly offering by the Data Science and History programs at the University of California at Berkeley. This course is of particular relevance to those working in civic tech contexts, giving a historical overview of ethics of institutions as it relates to data use, touching on timely issues ranging from predictive policing to elections, and supplying modern real-world illustrations of the importance of responsible data use by drawing on themes from the field of Science, Technology, and Society.  
- [USF Applied Data Ethics](https://ethics.fast.ai) **Practical Data Ethics** *FastAI/University of San Francisco* 2020 
  
  - As the name suggests, this is a practical course featuring immediate applications of data ethics, designed to be accessible to diverse audiences and thus requiring no formal prerequsites. Of particular value are Lesson 2, which defines metrics and bias, approaches to reduce bias, and real-life complexities of "doing fair AI/ML," and Lesson 3, Ethical Foundations & Practical Tools, which features work on Mitchell et al's Model Cards, and resources on [inclusive technology policy design](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-019-09497-z). 
- [USD AI and the Law](https://smithilaneous.typepad.com/artificial_intel_2020/2020/01/ai-and-the-law-welcome-and-syllabus.html) **Artificial Intelligence and the Law** *University of San Diego School of Law* 2020 
  
  - This course explores the legal implications of the proliferation of AI/ML technologies. The reading list offered in teh syllabus features papers on useful topics like Black Box AI, Discrimination, Manipulation and Due Process, and AI and Tort and Criminal Liability, which could offer a legal dimension of AI/Ml useful for those trying to delve into the social impact and policy implications of these technologies.
