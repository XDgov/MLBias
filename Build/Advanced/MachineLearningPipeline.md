# Bias throughout the Pipeline

In this section presents a high-level view of AI/ML bias, as might be encountered by a typical government practitioner. To this end, this section walks the reader through common sources of bias along the length of the machine learning pipeline, extended here to include composition of research and development and implementation teams before development even begins, and application of results to inform policies or programs at the tail end of the process.

In this section, we walk through common sources of bias along the machine learning pipeline, to prepare users for a later discussions of how to assess and mitigate bias along the workflow.

* Application of Bias, Including Even Distribution of Benefits and Risks First, Quotation from paper to include: "**what constitutes best practice in minimizing discriminatory bias and by what mechanism (antidiscrimination laws, consumer protection, industry standards) does society incentivize development and adoption of best practice?62 And second, how do we ensure that the risks and benefits of artificial intelligence are evenly distributed across society? Each set of questions is already occupying considerable resources and attention, including within the industries that build AI into their products, and yet few would dispute we have a long way to go before resolving them.**."

 1) increase racial diversity in AI designers, 2) implement AI impact assessment, 3) establish procedures for staff to contest automated decisions. Each proposal addresses a different stage in the lifecycle of AI used by federal agencies and helps align US policy with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Principles on Artificial Intelligence.
