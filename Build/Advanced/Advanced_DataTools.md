# Understanding your data

While some degree of data bias might be inevitable in large datasets and data genereated by or from humans, you should ideally understand its quality and reliability, along dimensions like potential dataset imbalances, missing data, and inconsistent naming conventions.
Below, we walk you through a series of tools and techniques to help you minimize the "bias footprint" of your data. 

## Bias and Fairness Metrics for Datasets

## Open source toolkits


Tool Name	Creator	Link	What does it do?	Interface	User Level (Technical / Non-Technical)	Open Source?	Description (one-liner)
What-If Tool	Google	https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/	Identify dataset imbalances, see how individual features impact your model's prediction through partial dependence plots, and analyze human-centered ML models from a fairness perspective using various optimization strategies.	Code notebook extension	Technical	Y	A visualization tool that you can run inside a Python notebook to analyze an ML model. With the What-If Tool, you will learn to identify dataset imbalances, see how individual features impact your model's prediction through partial dependence plots, and analyze human-centered ML models from a fairness perspective using various optimization strategies.
SHAP	Google	https://github.com/slundberg/shap	Interpret the output of any ML model and seeing how a model arrived at predictions for individual data points. Determines the contribution of each feature to the final prediction, instead of looking at local importance (compared to Lime). 	Python package	Technical	Y	A tool for interpreting the output of any ML model and seeing how a model arrived at predictions for individual data points
Aequitas	UChicago Center for Data Science and Public Policy	http://aequitas.dssg.io/	Audit machine learning models for discrimination and bias, and make informed and equitable decisions around developing and deploying predictive risk-assessment tools	Web UI	Non-technical	Y	An open source bias audit toolkit used to audit the predictions of machine learning based risk assessment tools to understand different types of biases, and make informed decisions about developing and deploying such systems. Usage is more friendly for non-technical users; you can upload a data set, select your metrics, and it will generate a written report with easy-to-understand explanations of how the data/model performed in the selected fairness metrics.
Responsible AI Toolkit	PwC	https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/data-and-analytics/artificial-intelligence/what-is-responsible-ai.html	Help you harness the power of AI in an ethical and responsible manner - from strategy through execution	?	Non-technical	N	suite of customizable frameworks, tools and processes designed to help you harness the power of AI in an ethical and responsible manner - from strategy through execution
AI Fairness 360 Toolkit	IBM	https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/artificial-intelligence/projects/ai-fairness-360/	examine, report, and mitigate discrimination and bias in machine learning models throughout the AI application lifecycle	Python / R API	Technical	Y	
Trailhead Responsible Creation of AI Course	Salesforce	https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/responsible-creation-of-artificial-intelligence	Four 10 minute course modules to introduce concepts of bias and fairness - not really a tookit.	Short online course	Non-technical	N	
Weights & Biases	Weights & Biases (private, for-profit company)	https://wandb.ai/	Track, compare, and visualize ML experiments (performance, hyperparameters, etc.) - no explicit bias features.	Python package 	Technical	Y-ish (free for academic and open source projects)	
Lime	University of Washington	https://www.oreilly.com/content/introduction-to-local-interpretable-model-agnostic-explanations-lime/	Explain any black box classifier (currently supports explaining individual predictions for text classifiers or classifiers that act on tables (numpy arrays of numerical or categorical data) or images). Explains local importance of a feature, not additive.	Python package	Technical	Y	
Ethics & Algorithms Tookit	The Center for Government Excellence (GovEx) at Johns Hopkins, the City and County of San Francisco, Harvard DataSmart, and Data Community DC	http://ethicstoolkit.ai/	Process that walks you through a series of questions to help you 1) understand the ethical risks posed by your use of an algorithm and then 2) identify what you can do to minimize those ethical risks. Designed for people building or acquiring algorithms in the government sector.	Process with worksheet	Non-technical, but probably requires technical support o answer the questions	Y	
Deon	DrivenData	https://deon.drivendata.org/	Command line tool that allows you to easily add an ethics checklist to your data science projects	Checklist	Technical-ish (CLI, questions require technical knowledge to answer)	Y	
Fairlearn	Microsoft	https://fairlearn.org/	Assess an AI system's fairness and mitigate any observed unfairness issues. Fairlearn contains mitigation algorithms as well as a Jupyter widget for model assessment	Python package	Technical	Y	
Algorithmic Equity Toolkit (AEKit)	ACLU Washington	https://www.aclu-wa.org/AEKit	Collection of four components designed to identify surveillance and decision-making technologies used by governments; make sense of how those technologies work; and pose questions about their impacts, effectiveness, and oversight	Process with flowcharts / worksheets / questions	Non-technical	Y
