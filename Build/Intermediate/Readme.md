## Build: Intermediate

This repository contains hands-on practical resources for building, deploying, retraining, and evaluating AI/ML models, with a particular emphasis on civic use cases and building in government contexts. 
The resources here are geared toward people in the intermediate stages of the AI/ML engineering or data science learning. If you have build a model before and have a nuanced grasp of ML beyond concepts and fundamentals, this is the place for you to get started.

 
* Tooling: The best of open source tools from universities and industrial research orgs.
* Best practices: Writeup of best practices extracted from introductory general resources across industry and academia.
* Step-by-step walkthrough of bias considerations along the AI/ML pipeline
