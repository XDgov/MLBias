* [Intermediate](https://github.com/XDgov/MLBias/tree/main/Build/Intermediate): Knowledgeable about the fundamentals, has used or created Python notebooks, has interacted with bias tools and frameworks, or has some other practical knowledge of AI/ML.  
* [Advanced](https://github.com/XDgov/MLBias/tree/main/Build/Advanced): Here to look for bias and fairness tools, techniques, and use cases to supplement substantial practical AI/ML experience.
