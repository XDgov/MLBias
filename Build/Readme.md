## Build

This repository contains hands-on practical resources for building, deploying, retraining, and evaluating AI/ML models, with a particular emphasis on civic use cases and building in government contexts.    

* Datasets: How should I benchmark my models? What are the state-of-the-art datasets given bias and fairness considerations and constraints? 
* Transfer Learning and Pre-trained Models: How can I use trained or partially-trained models to accelerate my build, while considering bias?
* Tooling: The best of open source tools from universities and industrial research orgs.
* Best practices: Writeup of best practices extracted from user research across government, industry publications, and research papers.
* Step-by-step walkthrough of bias considerations along the AI/ML pipeline
