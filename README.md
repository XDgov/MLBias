# Census/xD Bias Resource Repository

 [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)



The US Census Bureau xD team, in collaboration with the [10x](https://10x.gsa.gov) program, is building a library of machine learning and artificial intelligence resources to help combat bias introduced by bias and algorithms. We aim to create tools and resources for diverse audiences encompassing both technical and non-technical users.

## WHY: 

AI and machine learning-based tools and techniques are quickly being adopted and deployed across governments at all levels. The rapid pace of adoptions raise ethical concerns of using these tools in civic settings, particularly when they could be invoked to make high-stakes decisions. Invisible quality issues in datasets, biased data collection methods, bad data governance problems, and issues in model development have the potential to introduce enormous bias into decision-making processes that adversely and systematically affect vulnerable populations served by government programs

## WHAT: 

This collection currently includes a series of government use cases, annotated list of resources, and a Question-and-Answer flow tool to guide users toward the appropriate resource list according to their background, goals, and level of knowledge. 

## WHEN: 

A staged full release for the public-facing tool is planned throughout 2021.
