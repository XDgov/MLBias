Introduction
-------------

On this page, we list (free) online materials drawn from courses with diverse syllabi, projects, reading materials, and sample code/notebooks for those wishing to formally study these topics.  While we focused on courses from which we drew material for this project, we strongly encourage contributions of other courses to this page (particularly those from smaller academic or research institutions not represented here!). Please [drop us an email or create a Github issue](https://github.com/XDgov/MLBias/tree/main/Contribute) and let us know!    


Course Categories

### Technical

- [10718, 94889](https://github.com/dssg/mlforpublicpolicylab) **Data Analysis / Machine Learning for Public Policy Lab** *Carnegie Mellon University*, 2020 edition
	- This course, which assumes prior exposure to machine learning and proficiency with Python, is rich with material for those trying to get started building end-to-end machine learning pipelines for government applications, and who would like formal technical exposure to data analysis and machine learning work with ethical considerations. The course features a template for field projects suitable for training programs mini-courses. Lessons of interest to those interested in AI/ML ethics in civic tech/policy settings are the modules on Bias and Fairness, Model Explainability/Interpretability, and Field Validation.

- [RES.EC-001](https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-ec-001-exploring-fairness-in-machine-learning-for-international-development-spring-2020/index.htm#) **Exploring Fairness in Machine Learning for International Developments** *MIT*, Spring 2020 
	- Lightly technical short course offered in full through MIT's free Open Courseware resource, geared toward those interested in implementable applied methods for AI/ML ethics. Notable resources are a series of video lectures, and full case studies featuring data and technical approaches, including: Mitigating Gender Bias on the UCI Adult Database, a case study on Pulmonary Health, and a case study on Identifying and Mitigating Unintended Demographic Bias in Machine Learning for NLP.


### Less Technical Courses

- [Data c104 / History c184d](https://data.berkeley.edu/data-c104-fall-2020-syllabus) **Human Contexts and Ethics of Data** *UC Berkeley* Fall 2020 

   - An interesting course jointly offering by the Data Science and History programs at the University of California at Berkeley. This course is of particular relevance to those working in civic tech contexts, giving a historical overview of ethics of institutions as it relates to data use, touching on timely issues ranging from predictive policing to elections, and supplying modern real-world illustrations of the importance of responsible data use by drawing on themes from the field of Science, Technology, and Society.  
- [USF Applied Data Ethics](https://ethics.fast.ai) **Practical Data Ethics** *FastAI/University of San Francisco* 2020 
  
  - As the name suggests, this is a practical course featuring immediate applications of data ethics, designed to be accessible to diverse audiences and thus requiring no formal prerequsites. Of particular value are Lesson 2, which defines metrics and bias, approaches to reduce bias, and real-life complexities of "doing fair AI/ML," and Lesson 3, Ethical Foundations & Practical Tools, which features work on Mitchell et al's Model Cards, and resources on [inclusive technology policy design](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-019-09497-z). 
- [USD AI and the Law](https://smithilaneous.typepad.com/artificial_intel_2020/2020/01/ai-and-the-law-welcome-and-syllabus.html) **Artificial Intelligence and the Law** *University of San Diego School of Law* 2020 
  
  - This course explores the legal implications of the proliferation of AI/ML technologies. The reading list offered in teh syllabus features papers on useful topics like Black Box AI, Discrimination, Manipulation and Due Process, and AI and Tort and Criminal Liability, which could offer a legal dimension of AI/Ml useful for those trying to delve into the social impact and policy implications of these technologies.
